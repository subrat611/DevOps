## What is YAML

- YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language
- YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is often used for configuration files, data exchange between languages, and defining structured data.

> Data Serialization
>
> Is the process of converting structured data into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed later. It involves representing the data in a standardized and platform-independent manner.
>
> When data is serialized, its structure and values are converted into a sequence/stream of bytes or characters that can be written to a file, transmitted over a network, or stored in a database. This serialized representation can be later deserialized, or reconstructed, to retrieve the original data structure and values.
>
> Other commonly used serialization formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), and Protocol Buffers.

- YAML files are commonly used in conjunction with tools and frameworks like Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker Compose, and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) systems like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
